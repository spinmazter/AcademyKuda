      <h2>Coaching <span>Philosophy</span> </h2>
      <p>
        During my table tennis career, I have had the opportunity to see how some table tennis players develop into champions. It requires a combination of several factors, some of which you are born with and others which can be developed. In order to maximize your potential, you must be disciplined, coachable, and have a tremendous work ethic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every table tennis player is different and there is not just one way to stroke the ball. Although, we consistently teach the basic fundamentals of the game, each student is evaluated individually, and taught according to his/her own mental and physical capabilities and style. At Spinmasterz Table Tennis Academy we not only teach the fundamentals of playing the game, but we teach court etiquette; good sportsmanship on and off the table and being polite and courteous to players, coaches, referees, staff, “everyone”!
